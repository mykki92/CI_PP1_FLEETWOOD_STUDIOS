## Design

### Design Choices
The website was designed to be simple but stylish, the site uses multiple images so use of fonting and color was kept minimal so as not to overcrowd the pages.

### Colour
The font color was set to grey and black with a white background so as not to clash with other elements on the page and to present information simply and clearly. The background color of the textbox over the main image on the home page was color picked from the image to be consistent with the tone of the page. All pages were tested and validated for contrast.

### Fonts
Philosopher as the preferred font to be consistent with the tone and style of the page, with Arial as the websafe font and sans-serif as fallback.

### Structure
The page is structured in a simple, user-friendly and easily-navigatible way. Upon arriving at the website homepage, the user sees the studio logo on the top left side and the navigation links to the top right. The website consists of four separate pages:

- A homepage with an image of the studio and general information about the facilities.
- A rehearsal page detailing the different rehearsal rooms and the equipment available.
- A recording page featuring an image of the studio and more specific information about the recording facilities, equipment and personnel.
- A contact page with an enquiry and booking form, a map and contact information.
